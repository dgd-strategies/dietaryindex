Description: This package can help you calculating common dietary pattern indexes easily. 
    It can calculate AHEI-2010, AHEIP, DASH, DASHI, MED, MEDI, and HEI2015.
    All you need to do is to provide appropriate serving size for each food/nutrient category as indicated by the original article that created the index.
    Currently, the package cannot calculate the serving size from FFQ given that there are a variety of FFQs available, and it is difficult to accommodate all of them.
