Description: This package can help you calculating common dietary pattern indexes easily for almost all dietary assessments. 
    It can calculate AHEI-2010, AHEIP, DASH, DASHI, MED, MEDI, and HEI2015.
    All you need to do is to provide the relevant serving sizes for each food/nutrient category in the index.
    Currently, the package can calculate the serving sizes from BLOCK (BLOCKFFQ or NutritionQuest), AARP (NIH-AARP cohort), and NHANES_FPED (NHANES after year 2005).
    For NHANES_FPED, data preprocess using the NHANES_FPED_PRE_HEI15() function is needed in addition to the serving size and dietary index calculation.
    The dietaryindex package relies on the dplyr and readr packages.
