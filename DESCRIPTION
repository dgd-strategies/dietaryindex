Description: Currently, the package works for the following 4 dietary assessment tools to calculate many dietary indexes within 1 steps.
    1. It can calculate HEI2015, AHEI, AHEIP, DASH, DASHI, MED, MEDI, and DII for the Block FFQ. 
    2. It can calculate HEI2015, AHEI, DASH, MED, and DII for the NHANES_FPED (after 2005).
    3. It can calculate HEI2015, AHEI, DASH, MED, and DII for the ASA24
    4. It can calculate HEI2015, AHEI, DASH, MED, and DII for the NIH-AARP
    This package can also help you calculating these dietary pattern indexes from all other dietary assessments, if you provide the relevant serving sizes for each food/nutrient category.
    All you need to do is to provide the relevant serving sizes for each food/nutrient category in the index.
