# Agent Instructions

- Use `pytest -q` to run the Python unit tests located under `tests/`.
- Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`; run `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running tests if network access is available.
- If network access is unavailable, tests requiring packages like `pandas` may fail; see the README for guidance on devcontainer setup which installs these packages automatically.
