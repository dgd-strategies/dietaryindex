\arguments{
\item{SERV_DATA}{The raw data file that includes all the serving sizes of foods and nutrients}

\item{RESPONDENTID}{The unique participant ID for each participant}

\item{GENDER}{The gender for each participant, 1=male, and 2=female}

\item{VEG_SERV_ACS2020}{The serving size of All vegetable except potatoes and starchy vegetable, unit=servings/day (0.5 c of vege; 1 cup of green leafy (1 cup = 236.59 g)}

\item{VEG_ITEMS_SERV_ACS2020}{The total number of unique vegetables (e.g., vegetable line items) reported by the participant. For example, a report of 3 servings of lettuce, 1 serving of kale, and 0.5 servings of broccoli would count as 3 vegetable line items.}

\item{FRT_SERV_ACS2020}{The serving size of All whole fruits and no fruit juice, unit=servings/day (0.5 c of berries; 1 cup=236.59 g; 1 med fruit; 0.5 medium avocado)}

\item{FRT_ITEMS_SERV_ACS2020}{The number of unique fruits (e.g., fruit line items) asked about on that survey/app (measuring the variety of fruits). For example, 3 serving of apple, 3 servings of banana, and 3 servings of blueberry are just 3 total number line items}

\item{WGRAIN_SERV_ACS2020}{The serving size of whole grains, unit=grams/day}

\item{SSB_FRTJ_SERV_ACS2020}{The serving size of sugar-sweetened beverages and non-100\% fruit juice, unit=servings/day = 1 ser= 8oz (1 oz. = 28.35 g)}

\item{REDPROC_MEAT_SERV_ACS2020}{The serving size of red and processed meats, including Beef, pork, lamb, goat, veal, sausages, bacon, salami, ham, hot dog, deli meat, unit=servings/day; 1 srv= 4 oz. unprocessed meat; 1.5 oz. processed meat (1 oz. = 28.35 g)}

\item{HPFRG_RATIO_SERV_ACS2020}{The ratio of calories from highly processed foods and refined grains to the total daily calories (e.g. 35 % calories from HPF and ref grains)}

\description{
Calculate the American Cancer Society 2020 dietary index, using the daily serving sizes of foods consumed to calculate the vegetable, fruit, whole grain, red and processed meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages components. This version uses the percent of daily calories from highly processed foods and refined grains to calculate that componentâ€™s scores and is the preferred method of calculating the ACS 2020 diet score. To help identify what are highly processed foods, here are some references: https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/101/6/1251/4626878, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30744710/, http://archive.wphna.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WN-2016-7-1-3-28-38-Monteiro-Cannon-Levy-et-al-NOVA.pdf.
