Description: Currently, the package works for the following 5 dietary assessment tools to calculate many dietary indexes within 1 steps without data-preprocessing.
    1. It can calculate HEI2020, HEI2015, AHEI, DASH, DASHI, MED, MEDI, and DII for the NHANES.
    2. It can calculate HEI2020, HEI2015, AHEI, DASH, MED, and DII for the ASA24.
    3. It can calculate HEI2015, AHEI, DASH, and MED for the DHQ3.
    4. It can calculate HEI2015, AHEI, AHEIP, DASH, MED, and DII for the Block FFQ.
    This package can also help you calculating HEI2020, HEI2015, AHEI, AHEI-P, DASH (quintile-based), DASHI (serving size-based), aMED (median-based), MEDI (serving size-based), DII, American Cancer Society 2020 dietary index (ACS 2020), and Planetary Health Diet Index based on the EAT-Lancet Commission (PHDI)) using all other dietary assessments, if you provide the relevant serving sizes for each food/nutrient category.
    Outputs include the dietary index total score and component scores (for dataset-specific functions).
