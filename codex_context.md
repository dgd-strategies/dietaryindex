# Codex Context

This file provides context for GitHub Copilot / Codex about the `dietaryindex` repository.

The project contains an R package and accompanying Python utilities for calculating dietary pattern indices such as DII, MIND, and HEI. The package also includes a lightweight website for documentation.

Main directories:
- `R/` and `man/` contain the R package source and documentation.
- `dietaryindex_py/` provides Python implementations.
- `tests/` holds automated tests.
- `pkgdown/` serves the website output.

This context file is intended for development automation and has no impact on the package functionality.
